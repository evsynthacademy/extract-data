At the Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health, we use SRDR and Excel to extract our data, but you don’t necessarily need these tools. You can extract data using everything from other developed tools,  software you design yourself,  or a simple pad of paper and a pencil. 
<br><br>
Technology can make the job of data extraction easier, but it won’t do the work for you. Any approach will be successful as long as you think carefully about the data you’re extracting and design an organized approach to collecting and saving that data. 
<br><br>
But what happens if the data you’re collecting is inconsistent or missing? We’ll talk about that on the next page.
