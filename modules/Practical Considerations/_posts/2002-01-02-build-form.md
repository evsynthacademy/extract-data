## Build your form 


t would be easy if you could extract your data using one generic form, but unfortunately, every form needs to be customized to reflect your research topic and your key questions. <br><br>
Here are a few tips for getting started:<br><br>
- Organize your form logically, creating sections for each element in PICO (D), plus bibliographic information.
- Create structure in your form, but allow for flexibility to capture variability and any unexpected data.
- Build your form and then extract a few studies. Use what you discover to make the form better. Just don’t forget to return to those initial studies when you’ve finalized your form. <br><br>
It is impossible to design a perfect data extraction form on your first try; form development is often an iterative process. But don’t wait too long to finalize your form. Every time you make a change, you’ll have to go back to the studies you already reviewed and extract new data.
