## Data extraction tools

There is no one size fits all data extraction form, but we’ve developed some good tools for making the process easier.

In 2012, our team at CESH received funding from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to develop the [Systematic Review Data Repository](https://srdr.ahrq.gov/) or SRDR. SRDR aims to make it easier for researchers to extract, manage and store data for future use and reuse. 
It includes customizable extraction forms that you can use to collect and store your data in one place. If you’re looking for inspiration, you can even search for forms that other researchers have built for similar topics. <br><br>

Once you’ve built your form, you can share it with your team so everyone can use the same format to extract data.
SRDR is free and open to anyone, but you have to set up an account to use the service. If you [register on the SRDR training site](https://srdr.training.ahrq.gov/), you can start playing with the program right away.

Here’s a peek at the layout for SRDR:
