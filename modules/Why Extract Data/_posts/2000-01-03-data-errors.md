## Data errors in action

Here are a few examples of the kinds of errors you might notice when you’re extracting data:<br>
Read this passage from a real research study:<br><br>
> “Data for the 40 patients who were given all 4 doses of medications were considered evaluable for efficacy and safety. The overall study population consisted of 10 (44%) men and 24 (56%) women, with a racial composition of 38 (88%) whites and 5 (12%) blacks.”

<br><br>
How many patients were in this study? Be sure to look at the break down of men versus women and the racial composition of the participants. <br><br>

Here are some other examples.  We’ve reformatted the language and tables to make them easier to read, but they’re also from real studies.<br><br>

See if you can find the error in this paragraph:

What’s wrong in this table?

This table has a lot of data, but see if you can find the mistake.

Sometimes study errors aren’t as obvious as the examples above. You’ll also see data in tables that don’t match the text or the figures. <br><br>

There are lots of reasons why you might find errors in your studies. Sometimes, these mistakes are just typos. For example, in the table comparing Roxithomycin and Clarithromycin, notice that the ranges for age and weight are identical. So this mistake might have just been a copy and paste error. <br><br>

Also, when multiple authors are writing different sections of the same paper, they may miss places where their text doesn’t align. Other times, authors update older versions of their research without remembering to change all of the text.  <br><br>
Perhaps the study doesn’t actually have errors- it’s possible the authors just failed to clearly report their methods. In very rare cases, systematic reviewers have even uncovered potential fraud when they’ve found errors or unusual data.

Convinced that data extraction matters? Later in this course, we’ll discuss what to do when you find these kinds of errors in your research. For now, let’s start with the kind of information you’ll want to extract.
