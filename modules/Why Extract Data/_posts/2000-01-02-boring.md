## This sounds boring + time consuming

You might ask yourself, is this step really necessary? Can’t I just read every study and summarize the results in my final report? <br><br>
You could, but then you wouldn’t be conducting a systematic review. To systematically weigh and evaluate the existing evidence, you need to put all of your information into a standard format. That way, you can create informative tables and graphs that make it easy to summarize and compare information from different studies. And of course, any kind of meta-analysis is impossible without this step. <br><br>
But data extraction does more than just organize and standardize the results of your studies. It forces you to really look at the research. <br><br>
You’ll be surprised by what you find. Here’s what two systematic review experts had to say about the data extraction process:<br><br>

In other words, as you carefully pull out and organize the data in each of your studies, you’ll start to notice all kinds of errors and mistakes you might have missed if you just read the research. These inconsistencies will play a large part in your final conclusions about the reliability and quality of each study.
