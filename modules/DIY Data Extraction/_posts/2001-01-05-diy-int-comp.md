## DIY Intervention/Comparator


Itâ€™s important to extract information about the intervention and comparator arms, because this data will help you determining which studies can be combined together using meta-analysis.  Be sure to collect dosing data so you can investigate any relationship between the amount/frequency of any intervention and the response.  Dosage amounts will also help you  determine whether studies can be combined. The number of patients in each arm is usually essential for analysis, as well.
