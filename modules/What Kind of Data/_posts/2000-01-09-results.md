## Results

After you’ve collect data about the study design, you’ll want to collect the most important information: the results of the research!  <br><br>

You’ll be extracting both the findings of statistical analyses and raw data on your outcomes of interest from the research study. <br><br>

Here are some typical numbers and calculations that will go into the results section of your data extraction form: 
<br><br>
 
- Sample size
- Mean difference
- Standard errors/deviations
- Confidence intervals
- Counts of events
- Odds ratios/risk ratios
- Regression coefficients (adjusted and unadjusted for confounders)
- Models fit
<br><br>
For more information on how to combine and analyze these results, see our meta analysis course. <br><br>

Of course, the specific data you gather for all of these categories will vary depending on your question and the available research, but these initial suggestions will give you a good start. <br><br>

Now that you have a better idea of what you’re looking for, try extracting some data from a real study.
