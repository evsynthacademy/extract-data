## Population

For each research study in your systematic review, you’ll need quantitative information that paints a clear picture of the people who participated in the research.<br><br>

Here’s some of the data you should gather about the research participants in each study:<br><br>

- Age range and average age
- Number of males versus females
- Other demographic information: country of origin, educational level, economic background, etc
- How was each participant’s disease or condition defined/diagnosed?
- How severe was each participant's disease/condition?
- Did participants have any other related diseases or health issues?
- Is there any other baseline data about the participant’s health before the - intervention took place?
- Where did the participants receive the intervention/comparator?
- How long did each person participate in the study?
