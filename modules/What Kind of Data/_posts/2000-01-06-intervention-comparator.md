## Intervention and Comparator

The data you extract for the study intervention(s) is usually similar to the data you extract for a study’s comparator. That’s because, as you might remember, the comparator is just another intervention, a placebo, or the standard treatment for a specific disease or condition. In other words, it’s whatever the research study is using as a comparison for the intervention. <br><br>

In fact, we often use the word “arm” to describe both the comparator and the interventions, where each “arm” represents a different treatment approach. A study may have several arms if several different treatments are being compared. You’ll want to extract the same type of data for each arm, so you can create a fair comparison between each approach.<br><br>

But the data you extract will be slightly different depending on the type of intervention/comparator in each study. Here are are few examples of the key data to extract:<br><br>

- For a **medical** intervention/comparator:
    - Drugs used
    - Doses of those drugs
    - How were drugs administered (swallowed pill? In an IV? Any titration protocols?)
    - How frequently and how long did participants receive the drugs?<br><br>
- For a **surgical** intervention/comparator:
    - Type of surgery
    - Details about how surgery was performed
    - Type of materials used in the surgery
    - Experience level of the surgeon(s)
    - Anesthesia protocol<br><br>
- For an **exposure** (such as second hand smoke) 
    - Type of exposure
    - Duration of exposure
    - Intensity of exposure
    - Mechanism of exposure
    - How recent was the exposure? <br><br>
    
You might see the comparator described as inactive, placebo or “usual care.” This isn’t enough information.  Be sure to gather specific data on what the comparator was and how it was administered.
